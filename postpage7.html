<p><strong>Context:</strong> This web design project was created as part of a studio project, focused on practicing JavaScript forms and generating outputs based on user inputs.</p>
<p><strong>Role:</strong> Web Designer</p>
<p><strong>Project Type:</strong> Website Design with Figma, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</p>

  Low & Mid-Fidelity Designs

<p>I began this project by sketching out my initial concept. Inspired by the classic game Mad Libs, I designed an interactive experience where users provide various inputs to generate a playful, themed story. For this project, I chose a scenario in which users craft a funny email to excuse themselves from a responsibility.</p>

<p>Once I had finalized the design layout, I moved to Figma to select color palettes, fonts, and styling to bring my vision to life. During this phase, I also began brainstorming the user interactions and determining the necessary inputs to generate the final story.</p>

    Post-Feedback Mid-Fidelity Designs
</h3>
<p>After collaborating with other designers and refining my concept, I began planning the theme further and exploring the different options for user responses, such as radio buttons and drop-down menus. I decided to incorporate the idea that this was being sent out as an email and designed the results/output page to align with that.</p>

    Final Design & Development
</h3>
  <p>Developing this website was an enjoyable experience, particularly when it came to generating dynamic outputs based on user input. It allowed me to work with JavaScript in a new and challenging way. Additionally, I incorporated CSS animations to add a playful and engaging touch to the site.</p>

<p><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong> This project was an great opportunity to gain hands-on experience with JavaScript forms, allowing me to explore how forms function both on websites and in real-world applications. It gave me a better understanding of how user input is gathered and processed, and how to structure forms with usability in mind.</p>
