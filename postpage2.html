<p><strong>Context:</strong> After having just came back from visiting my cousins in Mexico, I was moved by the need for affordable and quality clothing over there. As a result, I set out to design a mobile application prototype that provides a platform where users could post or donate their unwanted clothes for free or for a very affordable price. The name of the app is a shortening of "Outside Outfits", hinting at the fact that clothes on the app are coming from all over. My idea was to offer free worldwide shipping so as to access places that need affordable clothes in order to leave little to no cost at all to those posting clothing items. I also had the idea of providing a messaging feature so that those who have donated can see the impact they have made and connect with others around the globe.</p>

<p>I first began by creating two seperate user personas, one for a person likely looking to donate or sell and the other for someone who is most likely looking to purchase or order an item.</p>

</div>
<p>In order to do this, I had to do some research and think about the different factors that may make someone want to donate their clothes or look towards an app or online for an answer. As well as why a person would prefer to donate their clothes and online shopping as opposed to throwing it away or looking for an affordable store.</p>

  UX/UI Design

<p>After doing research, I moved onto my low fidelity designs which I created in Figma using simple shapes to form a layout.</p>

<p>Once I made the log in, sign up, and customizable clothes option preferences, I then moved onto what a landing page would look like.</p>

</div>
<p>I then created the rest of the pages such as an order tracking page, a post page, and a for you page with suggested and recently viewed content.</p>

<p><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong> Overall, this was all a learning experience that helped me be more aware of user's thoughts, feelings and motivations. It took some time to figure out all the specifics and details of how the app would flow and function but this was a great project to help exercise my UI design and UX Researching skills</p>
