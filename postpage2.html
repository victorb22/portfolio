            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <div class="content">
              <p>After returning from a visit to my cousins in Mexico, I noticed a strong need for affordable, quality clothing in some communities. This inspired me to design a mobile application prototype, Outside Outfits, a platform where users can post or donate clothing for free in exchange for credits or at a very low cost.</p>
              <p>The app aims to remove common barriers in secondhand clothing exchange, such as location and shipping costs, by offering free worldwide shipping. From a UX perspective, my goal was to create an intuitive and inclusive experience. I included features like a messaging system so donors can see the impact of their contributions and connect with others globally.</p>
              <p>Throughout the design process, I focused on understanding user needs, simplifying interactions, and ensuring accessibility, with the intent of creating a seamless platform that encourages both giving and receiving clothing items across borders.</p>

            <h2>UX Research</h2>
        <div class="content2">
                <p>I started my research by creating two user personas: one representing someone likely to donate or sell clothing, and the other representing a person likely to browse and purchase items. These personas helped me focus on the needs, motivations, and behaviors of core users, guiding my design choices to create the best digital experience for both groups.</p>
              <img id="c2imgfix" src="images/p2userp.png" alt="ux persona">

                <p>To build these personas, I spoke to peers whose demographics are ages 18-23, prefer to shop on sites like Depop, students, and work part-time or are full-time students. I also considered factors that influence why someone might donate clothes or turn to an app for affordable fashion. I explored motivations such as convenience, sustainability, and why users might prefer online platforms over traditional stores or discarding clothing. This research helped me understand user behavior and informed design choices that would meet user needs.</p>

              <div class="content1stack">
                <p>To better understand the potential of my app and the challenges it might face, I created a SWOT analysis. This helped me see the value the platform could provide and the practical considerations that might affect the user experience. While working through this, I also explored feature ideas such as using a tracking code to let donors and recipients follow the journey of each clothing item.</p>

            <div class="content">
              <p>With my research insights in mind, I began sketching low-fidelity wireframes in Figma to explore how users would interact with the app. Starting with foundational screens like login, signup, and customizable clothing preferences, I established the structure for the onboarding flow.</p>

                <img src="images/lowfip21.png" alt="low-fi design">
                <p>I then expanded into more functional pages: a landing page to serve as the home hub, an order tracking page to provide transparency, a posting page for sharing clothing, and a personalized “For You” section to surface suggested and recently viewed content. These wireframes allowed me to test the overall navigation and ensure each feature supported the core user goals identified in research.</p>

              <p>I conducted two rounds of prototype testing with a total of 10 of my peers. Participants were between 18–23 years old, full-time students who actively shopped online. I observed how they navigated wireframes, noted points of confusion, and gathered feedback on clarity and usability.</p>

              <p>My insights from iterating with user testing guided my final design revisions and helped me refine the prototype's layout and flow. The final design showcases onboarding through login, signup, and preference selection; and a central landing page for navigation, functional tools like order tracking, donating and posting, and a personalized feed for discovery. I created the final version with usability, accessibility, and user needs I noted throughout my design process.</p>

               <p class="rand-text"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>
               <p>This project gave me the opportunity to better understand how user needs, motivations, and behaviors shape design decisions. While working through the flow and functionality, I learned the importance of testing, iterating, and staying flexible in my approach. In the end, it not only strengthened my UI design abilities but also gave me hands-on practice with UX research methods that I will continue to build on in future projects.</p>
