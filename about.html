                <p>Hello, I’m Victor! I’m a UI/UX designer who enjoys turning complex problems into designs that feel simple, approachable, and user-friendly. Over the past few years, I’ve worked as a UI/UX intern with startups and nonprofits, where I collaborated with cross-functional teams, conducted user research, and designed websites and platforms that improved accessibility and usability.</p>
                <p>At UC Davis, I studied Interactive Design and was actively involved in Design Interactive, a student-led design organization. There, I worked on projects ranging from mobile apps to redesigning existing platforms, which gave me the chance to strengthen my research, prototyping, and usability testing skills in a collaborative setting.</p>
                <p>For me, design is always about people first. I enjoy uncovering pain points through research, then sketching, testing, and refining ideas until the solution feels natural. Accessibility is a big priority in my work, and I focus on making sure designs are intuitive across both desktop and mobile. I believe design should balance clarity with creativity, and I’m always excited to keep learning, collaborating, and building experiences that make a positive impact.</p>
