            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>As part of the application process for my UI/UX Design Internship at TruckerSay, I was given a design challenge to create a social media web app for trucking professionals. The brief was intentionally open-ended, with only two main constraints: the design must be limited to 10 Figma screens or less, and the scope and functionality of the platform were up to me to define.</p>
                <p>This challenge tested my ability to scope a project, apply design thinking, and translate user needs into solutions. Since the trucking industry has unique communication and community needs, I focused on designing an experience that would help drivers connect, share updates, and exchange knowledge in a simple, approachable way.</p>
                <p>The project served as both a demonstration of my design process and my ability to communicate my decisions clearly during an interview.</p>

            <h2>UX Research</h2>
            <p id="rand-p-widthfix">Since I didn't have time for deep fieldwork, I conducted lightweight research focused on understanding trucking professionals’ needs and opportunities for a community platform. My research included:</p>
        <div class="content1 space-fix">
              <div class="content1stack">
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Review of TruckerSay’s Website:</strong> Identified existing features like news, mentorship, and community, then explored how they could be reimagined for a social media experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Competitive Analysis:</strong> Looked at LinkedIn for networking patterns, Instagram for social interactions (feed, likes, sharing), and trucking forums to understand community discussions.</li>
                <li><strong>Heuristic Review:</strong> Read trucking forums from Reddit to identify common needs that would support usability for trucking professionals.</li>
                <li><strong>User Needs Hypotheses:</strong> Long-haul truckers need quick connection tools, new drivers need mentorship, and industry professionals want reliable news and updates.</li>
                <li><strong>Design Constraints:</strong> With a 10-screen limit, I focused on my main features to create a feasable social platform centered on community, news, and mentorship.</li>

                <strong>UI Kit</strong>
                <p>After establishing the scope and main features, I created a UI kit for consistency across screens. Since this was a design challenge, I wanted to balance speed with reusable elements. I drew inspiration from the TruckerSay website to keep my design aligned with their existing brand identity:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Color Palette:</strong> Adapted TruckerSay’s primary colors to create a clean interface while ensuring contrast for accessibility.</li>
                <li><strong>Typography:</strong> Referenced the site’s font choices and hierarchy, simplifying them for readability for mobile screens.</li>
                <li><strong>Buttons & Icons:</strong> Drew from the site’s iconography style to maintain visual consistency.</li>
                <li><strong>Components:</strong> Built modular elements like cards, navigation bars, and buttons for consistency.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Final App Designs</h2>
            <div class="content2">
                <p>After creating low-fi wireframes in Figma to map out the user flows, I layered in elements from my UI kit to develop high-fi screens. This approach allowed me to establish my structure first, then focus on visual consistency and interactivity.<br>

                <br>With the typography, color, and components in place, I connected the final designs into an interactive prototype for submission.<br>

                <br>Below is the final video showcasing the prototype:</p>

               <p class="rand-text"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>
              <p>This design challenge gave me the opportunity to practice the full design process under real constraints. Working within the 10-screen limit taught me how to prioritize essential features and design for clarity, while still keeping the experience engaging for users. The project not only helped me secure the UI/UX internship at TruckerSay, but also reinforced the importance of process-driven design and balancing user needs, brand identity, and usability in every design decision.</p>
