            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <div class="content">
              <p>This project was developed as part of a business course with the goal of designing a social learning platform specifically for UC Davis students. Drawing inspiration from platforms like Skillshare, Coursera, and MasterClass, I set out to create a campus-focused solution that supports existing UCD courses across different majors.</p>
              <p>The intent was to provide students with a more tailored and accessible way to explore new subjects, discover major options, and connect with peers through shared learning experiences. My role focused on understanding student needs and translating them into an example of a website we could present that balanced usability and accessibility.</p>
              <p>This is a project I’m currently working on and continuing to design and expand.</p>
              <p><strong>Role:</strong> UI/UX Designer</p>

                <strong>UX Persona</strong>
                <p>I wanted to better understand my target audience, so I began by researching the academic experiences of UC Davis students. I interviewed four undergraduates and discovered that more than 50% of UC Davis students change their major at least once.<br> <br>These insights highlighted the uncertainty and curiosity many students face when exploring different paths. Using this research, I created a user persona representing a UC Davis student navigating major exploration, which helped guide design decisions to address their needs and challenges.</p>

                <strong>Competitive Analysis</strong>
                <p>I conducted a competitive analysis of Coursera, Skillshare, and MasterClass. I compared their course offerings, pricing, and value propositions to understand strengths and gaps in the online learning market.</p>
                <p>I saw an opportunity to design a campus-specific site that combines the credibility of structured learning with the accessibility and affordability students need. By focusing on UC Davis students, the platform would offer specialized content that aligns with coursework and creates a community-based learning experience that competitors lack.</p>

            <p>I then moved into low-fidelity wireframes in Figma to establish the structure of the platform. I began by laying out the landing page for returning users, focusing on clarity and easy navigation.<br> <br>Recommended and current courses were organized into card layouts, making it simple for students to scan, recognize, and select content. This approach helped me visualize how information would be prioritized and how users could quickly access courses that were most relevant to them.</p>

              <div class="content1stack">
                <p>After establishing my layout, I created a Figma UI kit to ensure consistency across the platform, defining typography, colors, and reusable components like dropdowns, course cards, and buttons. This helped me maintain a consistent design style as new content and features were added.</p>

          <div class="content2">
            <p>Using the UI kit, I applied colors, fonts, images, and course information to my wireframes to create the mid-fidelity design. This brought the layouts to life while maintaining consistency across course cards and components.</p>

          <p>I then continued refining this landing page for returning users to present for my business project. Here is a video showcasing the final design and components. I am continuing to expand the project by adding more screens and features in the future.</p>

          <p class="rand-text"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>
          <p>This project showed me the value of understanding my target audience and conducting competitive analysis to identify gaps and opportunities. Designing with these insights helped me further consider users’ needs while leaving room for future improvements.</p>
