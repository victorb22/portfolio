            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Growing up in Concord, CA, I volunteered at Monument Crisis Center, a nonprofit supporting low-income households and immigrants and refugees.</p>
                <p>For this UI/UX project, I created a mockup website called Monument Initiative Center, inspired by nonprofits with similar missions.</p>
                <p>My <strong>goal</strong> was to research existing nonprofit websites, identify areas for improvement, and design a more user-friendly, effective digital experience.</p>

            <h2>UX Research</h2>
            <div class="content2">
                <p>To inform my design, I conducted a competitor analysis of two nonprofits that currently serve the area and population demographic I am making this website mockup for: Monument Crisis Center and Monument Impact.<br> <br>I examined their websites’ layouts, navigation, content organization, and accessibility to identify strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for improvement. Insights from this analysis helped guide decisions about structure, functionality, and user experience in my own design.</p>
                <img src="images/p5-redesign2.png" alt="Monument crisis center website">
                <p>Analyzing Monument Crisis Center’s website revealed potential pain points common to nonprofit sites. The landing page is crowded with text and information, which can overwhelm visitors, and the unclear hierarchy and page layout create friction during navigation. Identifying these challenges helped me understand where improvements could be made to create a clearer, more user-friendly experience in my own design.</p>
                <img src="images/p5-redesign1.png" alt="Monument Impact website">
                <p>Monument Impact’s website showed improvements in clarity, hierarchy, and layout compared to other nonprofit sites. However, there were still opportunities to enhance the user experience, particularly with CTA buttons, section organization, and overall flow.</p>

              <div class="content1stack">
                <p>To better understand the audience this nonprofit—and others with similar missions—could serve, I started by looking at demographic and behavioral data from the target region.</p>

              <div class="content1stack">
                <p>From this information, I created user personas that reflected the community’s common barriers, device/media usage, and everyday needs. This helped me shape design decisions around what would be most useful and accessible for them.</p>

            <div class="content2">
            <p>Based on the data I collected, I created three user personas that represent potential visitors to the nonprofit’s site. Each persona highlights different goals, challenges, and motivations, ranging from seeking general information to accessing specific resources. These personas helped me keep the design focused on real user needs and ensured that features and content would support a diverse set of visitors.</p>

            <h2>UI/UX Design</h2>
          <div class="content2">
            <p>I created a content outline to make sure the nonprofit’s resources would be clear and easy to access from the homepage. Nonprofit websites often have a large amount of information about services, programs, and the organization itself, so mapping out the content early allowed me to organize everything into a logical structure. This step helped me identify priorities, avoid missing key information, and set the foundation for a site that feels approachable and easy to navigate.</p>

          <div class="content2">
            <p>After finalizing the content outline, I moved on to low-fidelity sketches on paper for the desktop view. This allowed me to quickly explore layout options and see how the content structure could be made into a clear interface. Working on paper allowed me to test different ways of presenting resources, navigation, and CTAs without being limited by visual design details.</p>

          <div class="content2">
            <p>It was important for me to include mobile view as many people in our target audience have limited access to technology, so I had to consider the user and accesibility. It is often the case where they are viewing the site from their mobile phone, so a mobile view makes sense and offers an inclusive and user-centered design.</p>

              <div class="content1stack">
                <p>To establish consistency across the site, I created a UI kit that included the color palette, typography, logo usage, and core components such as buttons and form elements.<br> <br>I then applied the colors, typography, and components across the final designs, and did prototype testing with 6 of my peers and received help with making my site more user-friendly and organized.<br> <br>This brought consistency to both desktop and mobile views, creating a cohesive experience that is accessible and easy to navigate through informational content.</p>

          <h2>Final Design</h2>
          <div class="content2">
            <p>My goal with this website was to create a clear and resourceful platform for a nonprofit serving primarily low-income, immigrant families and residents. I focused on making information easy to find for both those seeking assistance and those interested in donating.<br> <br>To achieve this, I used color and title hierarchies for clear navigation, along with spacing and containers to prevent the site from feeling text-heavy. Since many in the target audience are ESL speakers, I emphasized translation options and highlighted programs such as ESL and professional development classes.</p>

          <p class="rand-text"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>
            <p>With this project, I was able to experiment with layout, while trying to balance clarity with accessibility. I made sure to include features that made the site informative and practical for users, such as an events calendar to keep the community updated and card layouts that make resources easier to scan. These design choices ensured that the site wasn’t just visually clear, but also actionable for users who need quick access to information. This project gave me the chance to explore a new industry, strengthen my research process, and become more intentional about designing with users’ needs in mind.</p>
