  Background
</h3>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Growing up in the East Bay, specifically Concord, CA, I volunteered at a nonprofit called Monument Crisis Center that served low-income households and immigrants and refugees in my local community. As a UI/UX project, I decided to make a mockup website design for a nonprofit with similar services that would be called Monument Initiative Center. My goal was to research nonprofits and their websites to improve upon websites that are currently out there.</p>
<p><strong>Role:</strong> UI/UX Designer</p>
<p><strong>Project Type:</strong> Website Design with Figma</p>

  UI/UX Research
</h3>
<p><strong>Methods:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Competitor Analysis</li>
  <li>Target Audience / User Research</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Potential Pain Points:</strong> Existing nonprofit websites can be hard to navigate due to the excess of information trying to be presented to the user. Friction is often encountered during navigation as a result of an unclear hierarchy and poor page layout organization.</p>
<p>I started off my research by visiting and reviewing the websites of 2 nonprofits that currently serve the area and population demographic I am making this website mockup for. The first was Monument Crisis Center, which has a crowded landing page with a lot of text and information that can be overwhelming for site visitors.</p>

<p>The second nonprofit was Monument Impact which is also located in Concord, CA. There website was an improvement but could still work on some of its call to action buttons and sections, as well as its user experience.</p>

<p>I then looked to learn more about the demographic of people this nonprofit and those similar to it could serve. I began with listing different demographic data and creating user personas based on the location I was focusing on and existing population.</p>

  UX Personas
</h3>
<p>Based off this data collected, I created 3 user personas for potential people that could be visiting our site in search of general information or the resources we provide as a nonprofit.</p>

    Low-Fidelity Designs
</h3>
<p>I began with creating a content outline bacuase I knew how important it was to ensure the resources the nonprofit provides are clear and easily accessible from the homepage. There is also often a lot of information about services and the organization on nonprofit websites so I wanted to make sure I didn't miss anything and had everything laid out in an organized structure.</p>
<div class="imageposts">
    <img src="images/p5-content-outline.png" alt="website content outline" width="800">

<p>From here, I moved onto low-fidelity designs, first for desktop, and then for mobile view.</p>

</div>
<p>It was important for me to include mobile view as many people in our target audience have limited access to technology, so I had to consider the user and accesibility. It is often the case where they are viewing the site from their mobile phone, so a mobile view makes sense and offers an inclusive and user-centered design.</p>

<p><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong> With this website, my goal was to create an informative and resourceful website for a non-profit that serves majority low-income, immigrant families and residents. My intention was to make information clear to those looking to donate or looking for assistance. I accomplished this through my color and title hierarchies that helped lay out the main sections of the website. I also tried using spacing and boxes to help separate information so as to not appear so wordy. Since my target audience includes those that are ESL, I also wanted to make a translation button stand out and offer services such as ESL and professional development classes on my website. What I am most proud of with this website is the layout. In the end, it was fun to explore a new industry and their websites, I really think this project strengthened my research skills and helped me be more considerate of users when designing.</p>
