            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Goodreads is a popular platform that allows readers to track books, log reviews, and discover new recommendations. Despite its widespread use, it often receives criticism for its outdated interface, cluttered navigation, and underwhelming social features. Many users feel the platform has not evolved to meet the needs of today’s readers.</p>
                <p>This redesign project set out to explore how Goodreads could better support readers through a more modern, intuitive, and engaging experience. The focus was on addressing usability pain points, improving information architecture and visual hierarchy, and creating a design that feels more aligned with the way people share and discover books today.</p>
                <p><strong>The Problem</strong>: How can we redesign Goodreads to maintain the website’s features while improving its visual appeal and ease of use? </p>

            <strong>Research Goals:</strong>
            <ul>
            <li>Analyze the current user base of Goodreads to cater our redesign to the target audience</li>
            <li>Understand Goodreads’ key strengths and weaknesses to learn which features should be kept and which should be removed</li>
            <li>Study competitors’ websites to uncover their most useful features</li>

            <div class="content1stack">
            <strong>Research Methods:</strong>
            <p>Our research focused on identifying user pain points and opportunities for improvement. We reviewed <strong>user feedback and reviews</strong> of Goodreads to understand common frustrations with the platform’s usability and features. We also conducted a <strong>competitive analysis</strong> of platforms like Letterboxd (for its social and community-driven design) and Hardcover (a modern Goodreads alternative) to see what works well for readers and where Goodreads falls short.</p>

        <p id="randfix" class="rand-text"><strong>User Feedback & Reviews</strong></p>
        <p id="rand-p-widthfix">To better understand user frustrations with Goodreads, we analyzed reviews from Trustpilot, where the platform holds an average rating of 2.2/5. Many reviewers highlighted recurring issues with the app’s outdated design, confusing navigation, and poor usability.</p>
        <div class="content1 space-fix">
            <div class="content1stack">
                <ul>
                    <li>Users described the interface as “old” and in need of a serious revamp.</li>
                    <li>Adding or managing books was called “confusing” and “not optimized”, with some noting they felt they needed tutorials to perform basic actions.</li>
                    <li>Several reviews criticized the overall user experience and layout, pointing out difficulties with tasks like joining as an author or adding a book.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These reviews reinforced the need for a redesign focused on modernizing the interface, simplifying flows, and creating a more intuitive experience for readers.</p>

                <p>From Letterboxd, we observed how a platform can feel both social and structured. Its feed and profile design made community interaction feel natural, while its clean navigation encouraged exploration.<br> <br>At the same time, the dense organization of film pages showed us the importance of avoiding feature overload when presenting large sets of content.</p>

                <p>Hardcover provided a smoother navigation and modern visuals. Its interface felt approachable and easy to scan, which helped users focus on key actions right away.<br> <br>However, its lack of community-driven features showed that even if it's a nicely organized platform, it's still missing a community and not connecting readers.</p>

                    <li>Visually unappealing design that makes the website appear outdated</li>
                    <li>Weak sense of hierarchy and unclear calls to action</li>

                <strong>Our Solution</strong>
                <p>We plan to redesign the Goodreads website to prioritize easy navigation, supported through a strong sense of contrast and hierarchy. We aim to incorporate a more unified and vibrant color scheme, giving the website more visual appeal. Lastly, we will place a greater emphasis on community features to allow people to follow their friends’ activity.</p>

                <strong>User Flow</strong>
                <p>To begin our UI/UX design process, we first mapped out the user flow to understand how readers would move through the platform. Since the home page acts as the main entry point, we treated it as the foundation from which all other navigation would stem.</p>

                <p class="rand-text"><strong>Low-Fidelity Home Page</strong></p>
                <p>We then created low-fidelity sketches on paper, focusing on how the homepage could connect to our other flows such as sign-up, account creation, and content discovery. By starting with the homepage and branching outward, we ensured that the design remained consistent and that users could move intuitively between features.</p>

                <p>With a clear understanding of the site flow and homepage structure, we moved into mid-fidelity wireframes. We also established our <strong>goals</strong> for our mid-fi designs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create a basic structure and hierarchy for the website</li>

                <p>After establishing the layout of our mid-fidelity wireframes, we moved onto the UI kit/design system. With the kit, we aimed to expand on the current Goodreads color scheme, adding more green accents for better contrast. As well as, adding brighter green buttons as clear calls to action</p>

                <p>With the UI kit in place and the page structures defined, we moved into creating the final high-fidelity designs of the platform.<br> <br>We had <strong>goals</strong> we wanted to aim to achieve with these high-fidelity designs and they were:</p>

              <p>Through this project, we saw how analyzing successful competitors helps reveal common design patterns and user expectations. We also strengthened our skills in building with Figma components and created an organized design system for frequently used colors, buttons, and elements.<br> <br>Moving forward, we plan to expand the redesign by adding a messaging system between users, finalizing the profile page with “Want to Read” and list sections, and implementing a dropdown menu for the profile icon in the navigation bar.</p>
