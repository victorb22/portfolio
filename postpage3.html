  Background
</h3>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> This was my first project from my first internship. It was with a company called TruckerSay and I got the opportunity to work closely with the COO (Chief Operating Officer). This company aimed to provide a platform which would help both trucking service providers and truckers with make the best informed decisions for either their careers or companies. This was planned to be done by designing a Yelp sort of web service in which providers or businesses in the trucking industry could leave reviews and do research on companies they may want to hire or work for. My task was to create a landing homepage for the website, a sign-up flow, and the entire flow of the search pages, company profiles, and other features that came with creating an account and viewing pages. (Due to a NDA, I can't show all the work I did for this company at this moment). </p>

  UX Research
</h3>
<p>At the beginning of my internship, I spoke with 15 truck drivers to understand their experiences in choosing employers. I wanted to learn how they figure out which companies are worth working for and what that decision-making process looks like for them. While I asked about several topics related to our planned features, one insight stood out—many drivers struggled to determine which employers were reputable because there wasn’t a dedicated review platform. With this in mind, I created two user personas that reflected the challenges and needs I saw in the survey responses, combined with my own research.</p>

  UX/UI Design 
</h3>
<p>From here, I moved onto the low-fidelity design phase for the company's homepage. I first started by drawing my designs for the homepage on paper, and then digitally after we received some feedback from the executive and design teams. We decided to aim to provide not only a review platform, but also integrate a separate interface and dashboard for businesses signing up for this site and integrating a rewards systems for users to encourage activity on the platform also.</p>

<p>We also began to work on what the rewards design could be and features it could include, such as badges to represent a user's level of activity and how long they've been a member of the platform.</p>

  Final Designs
</h3>
<p>Over the course of several months, we finalized the entire website for TruckerSay. This included profile and company pages, sign-up and log-in, search and review pages, trucking provider sign-up, and provider dashboards. The startup has yet to launch so the amount of my work I can show is constrained by a NDA.</p>

<p>With the homepage, we aimed to create calls to action to sign-up to earn rewards, and to mostly inform the visitors of the benefits and what the company does. Above is the sign-up page and the homepage design was finalized to look like this:</p>
<div class="imageposts">

</div>
<p>For the search to review pages, I mostly worked on designing for all search possibilities. This included thinking about what a user may want to see on the landing page for this feature and what would happen if their search matched or didn't match. Or if they wanted to navigate towards a company's account page and review their content. A search that didn't match prompted the user to add the company, similar to Yelp, which was an entire other flow I designed as well. The final designs of the landing pages for reviewing providers and new businesses looking to sign up were finalized to this:</p>

</div>

<p>The reward pages were also completed, and provided a space for users to review their activity, manage accounts, and track their points to eventually win prizes they can use on the road. As well as the trucking provider dashboard, which is an entirely seperate interface feature from regular users.</p>

<p>And here is a final video showcasing some of the designs such as provider account and search results.</p>

<p><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong> Overall, after completing this internship, I grew a lot as a designer and saw how valuable it is to effectively collaborate with others. This experience helped me put into practice what I have been learning in my design courses at UC Davis and I plan to take all the lessons learned with me as I move further into my career.</p>
