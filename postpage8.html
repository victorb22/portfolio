  Initial Design and Development
</h3>
<p>This project began with gathering images and brainstorming ideas for the site. I decided to base it on my first trip to Mexico, showcasing some of the memorable moments I captured during my visit. Once I had a clear concept, I moved on to the coding phase to test the functionality of my idea. This was my initial draft, where I focused on experimenting with JavaScript to make sure it worked with the image divs, overlays, and close buttons. It helped me test some of the features and ensure they were working before further moving forward with development. Here's a short video showcasing that:</p>
<div class="imageposts">
    <video controls width="600">
        <source src="images/p8-firstvid.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        <source src="images/p8-firstvid.webm" type="video/webm">
        <source src="images/p8-firstvid.ogv" type="video/ogg">
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>
</div>

    Final Design & Development
</h3>
<p>After creating the initial site and receiving feedback from other designers, I realized that a horizontal layout would be more effective for user interaction and viewing. I also added background color to the image divs on hover to better highlight which section the user is on. Additionally, I included arrows on the image slideshows to signal that there are multiple images to view, making the navigation more intuitive.</p>
<div class="imageposts">
        <video controls width="600">
            <source src="images/p9-vid.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            <source src="images/p9-vid.webm" type="video/webm">
            <source src="images/p9-vid.ogv" type="video/ogg">
            Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>
</div>
<p>And here is the link to the live <a href="https://victorb22.github.io/des157a/madlibs/v2/index.html">website</a> now and a video that showcases the site.</p>
<p><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong> This project was a good opportunity to practice developing interactive features and working with images and JavaScript. Overall, it was a valuable experience for improving my technical skills in web development.</p>
