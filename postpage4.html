            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>During my internship with HikeHER Dallas, a social impact organization, I was tasked with redesigning their old website. I collaborated closely with the executive team and led the design team throughout the project. HikeHER Dallas empowers the breast cancer community through group hikes, shared outdoor experiences, and hosting fundraisers to provide resources, care packages, and events.</p>
                <p>For the redesign,<strong> my goal</strong> was to create a digital space that <strong>fostered community</strong>, <strong>provided clear access to information</strong>, and <strong>kept members connected to upcoming events</strong>. The previous website faced <strong>key challenges:</strong> it lacked sufficient information for both current and potential members, and its information architecture failed to fully introduce the organization or clearly communicate what it does.</p>
                <p>The final site included a blog, events calendar, donation portal, sponsor sign-up page, homepage, and a founder’s section — each designed to reflect the organization’s mission and values.</p>

              <strong>UX Persona</strong>
                <p>For my user research, I sent out a survey to four current HikeHer members and two women who were considering attending an upcoming hike. The questions covered both personal background and their relationship with the organization — including their goals, challenges, event participation habits, and what information they look for most on the website.</p>
                <p>I supplemented the survey responses I collected with data-driven research to create a user persona to identify key variables, spot patterns of pain points/site strengths, and focus on our target audience.</p>

            <div class="content2">
                <p>I began the design phase with low-fidelity wireframes of HikeHER’s homepage to map out the overall structure before focusing on visual details. My goal was to lay out all planned features and potential user flows so the site could function as a one-stop platform for the community.<br> <br>Working closely with the executive team, I identified key pages — including Events, Donations, and a Blog — that would address the needs of both new visitors and existing members. Once the layout and navigation paths were clear, I moved into refining the UI design, applying the organization’s brand identity and visual style to bring the structure to life.</p>

                <p>After finalizing the homepage’s structure and flow, I shifted focus to building the UI kit and design system, ensuring consistent components, typography, and color usage across the project.</p>

            <div class="content2">
              <p>With the UI kit and homepage structure in place, I moved on to designing the remaining pages, applying the established styling and components to maintain visual and functional consistency throughout the site.<br> <br>For the blog and events pages, I wanted to make sure upcoming, current, and past posts were available to viewers. As well as, in the case of the events page, make it easy to access and add to their calendar. Below are the low/mid fidelity designs for events, blog, and donations.</p>

              <p class="rand-text"><strong>Donations Page</strong></p>
              <p>For the donations page, it was essential it be impactful and clearly describe the company's mission and goals. I focused on creating clear CTAs and information layout so visitors could quickly understand how their contributions would make a difference and where the funds would go.</p>

              <p>For the redesigned homepage, I built upon their existing site to better reflect the organization’s purpose, highlight the community, and showcase the value of membership. Throughout this process, I worked closely with the development team to ensure my design decisions were both impactful and feasible for implementation.</p>

              <p class="rand-text"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>
              <p>This project required me to research and understand the users’ perspectives. Diving into an unfamiliar field pushed me to adapt quickly, analyze user behaviors, and design solutions that aligned with their needs. It also reinforced the importance of combining clear structure with engaging visuals, and collaborating with the development team to ensure the design was both impactful and achievable. I would have liked to design a mobile version as well, since surveys showed some users were mobile-first, but it was outside the scope of this project and what was asked of me at the time.</p>
