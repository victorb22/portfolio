<p><strong>Context:</strong> My third internship began in September of 2024 with a Dallas based social impact organization named HikeHER Dallas. I once again had the opportunity to work closely with the executive team for this organization and led the design team. HikeHer Dallas is all about empowering women through group hikes and creating meaningful outdoor experiences. They host fundraisers to uplift and support the breast cancer community with resources, care packages, and events. For their website redesign, I worked on creating pages for their blog, events, donations, sponsor sign-up, homepage, and a section about the founder, making sure their mission and values came through in every part of the site.</p>
<p><strong>Role:</strong> UI/UX Design Intern</p>
<p><strong>Brand:</strong> HikeHER Dallas</p>
<p><strong>Project Type:</strong> Desktop Web Design with Figma and Development</p>

  UX/UI Design
</h3>
<p>After meeting with the founder of the organization and reviewing their current website, I began a low fidelity design of the company's homepage. They had an established following and wanted to provide more features that would make their website a one-stop platform for all things HikeHer Dallas. This is why I, along with the executive team, planned to have and create pages that provided all the information an interested or established user would want to browse; such as events, donation information, and a blog.</p>

<p>For the blog and events pages, I wanted to make upcoming, current, and past posts to be available to viewers. As well as, make it easy for them to access and add to their calendar, in the case of the events page. Below are the low and mid fidelity designs for the blog, events, and donations pages.</p>

  <p>For the donations page, it was essential that it be impactful and clearly describe the company's mission and goals. I wanted to make it clear how funds would help and the resources they would be going to.</p>

  Final Design and Web Development
</h3>
<p>First, here is the design for the homepage: With this design, I built upon their current website to further reflect the purpose of the organization and offer more information about the community and what it is to be a member. Throughout this process, I was collaborating with the development team to ensure that my ideas were realistic and something they could create in HTML,CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

<p>And then here is the link to the live <a href="https://www.hikeher.org/">website</a> now and a video that showcases all of the pages I designed.</p>

<p><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong> This internship was also a learning experience, as I was once again designing for an organization in an industry that required me to research and understand the users' perspectives. Diving into an unfamiliar field pushed me to adapt quickly, analyze user behaviors, and design solutions that align with their needs.</p>
